# AnyPrompts

AnyPrompts is a Next.js application that serves as a user-generated database for AI prompts. It allows users to post their own AI prompts that can be used with Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5. This application aims to provide a platform for sharing and discovering interesting prompts that can be used to generate creative and informative outputs.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: AnyPrompts provides a user authentication system that allows users to create accounts, log in, and securely access the application's features.

- **Post Prompts**: Registered users can submit their AI prompts to the database. These prompts should be concise and well-formulated to generate meaningful and coherent responses from LLMs.

- **Browse and Search**: Users can browse and search for existing prompts in the database. The application provides various filters and sorting options to help users find prompts that match their interests.

- **Prompt Details**: Each prompt has its own dedicated page that displays additional details such as the prompt's author, submission date, and any user-generated tags or categories associated with it.

- **Prompts Ratings and Feedback**: Users can rate and provide feedback on prompts. This feature enables the community to engage in discussions and provide valuable insights on the quality and usefulness of different prompts.

- **User Profiles**: AnyPrompts offers user profiles where users can manage their submitted prompts, view their ratings and feedback, and track their overall contributions to the platform.

## Getting Started

To get started with AnyPrompts, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/anyprompts.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd anyprompts`

3. Install the dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`

4. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and configure the following environment variables:

   ```plaintext
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=YOUR_API_URL
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_APP_ID=YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_API_URL` with the URL of the API that interacts with the AnyPrompts database. If you don't have an API yet, you can use a mock API or create one based on your specific requirements.

5. Start the development server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the AnyPrompts application.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: AnyPrompts is built using the Next.js framework, which provides a fast and efficient way to create React applications with server-side rendering and other performance optimizations.

- **React**: Next.js relies on React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture makes it easy to create reusable and interactive UI elements.

- **Tailwind CSS**: AnyPrompts utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling. Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a wide range of pre-built styles and enables rapid UI development.

- **MongoDB**: The application uses MongoDB or a compatible database as the backend data store for storing prompts, user information, ratings, and feedback.

- **Authentication**: AnyPrompts integrates with third-party authentication providers like Google and Facebook to handle user authentication and account management.

- **API**: The application interacts with a custom API that provides the necessary endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting prompts from the database. You'll need to create or set up an API to use with AnyPrompts.
